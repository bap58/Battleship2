        android:text="Battleship. This is a 2-Player game in which players compete to win. Each player locates 5 ships in a 10 by 10 board, and the adversaries alternate taking turns to guess the coordinates where they believe an opponent’s piece is. The player who first finds (sinks) the competition’s fleet wins.

\n\nContents of the game. In this mobile application version, each player has two boards. The first displays where the player’s ships are located and where it has been hit by the opponent. The second shows where the player has played its moves, where he has missed, and where he has hit.

\n\nGame preparation. Each player has to arrange the five ships on a 10 by 10 board. The board will have the ships placed in randomized locations, then it is up to the user to make further changes before beginning.

\n\nShips. There are five ships of different sizes. Aircraft carrier (length 5), battleship (length 4), submarine (length 3), cruiser (length 3), destroyer (length 2).

\n\nPlayer Board. Displays where the player set the ships. If the opponent has played, it shows the success (red) and failed attempts (white) to guess the set ships.

\n\nOpponent Board. Displays the moves the player has made. It shows the success (red) and failed attempts (white) to guess the set ships.

\n\nDecide which player is Player 1 and which is Player 2. The game will consider the player who first completes his board and presses the “ready for battle” button to be Player 1.

\n\nPlace a white marking peg on the target grid coordinate where you intend to fire. The target grid is the upright grid in between the 2 players.

\n\nPlay. The player selects a square on the opponent’s board where he or she believes the opponent’s ship is located. The players will alternate turns after their own selection.  Additionally, the player can toggle between board views, displaying their own ships or the opponent’s board with  hits and misses.

\n\nContinue until all 5 ships on one side are sunk. At this point, the game announces, Enemy fleet destroyed. Congratulations, Admiral."/>
